This is my new personal website using NextJS.

The rig is built with pure CSS/SASS. I'm not using any images besides the obvious ones on the screen.

If you need a hint on how to solve the puzzles, try clicking the direction buttons quickly on the bottom panel and you might see something you missed.

I used my NextJS boilerplate to build this.
